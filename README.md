## About this project
This project could easily be labeled as a true "Higher Order Functions Extravaganza", with almost three hundred lines of vanilla JS, it was such a nice ride. I still remember how troublesome it was at the time to do this project, which is why it became quite dear to me, for it has taught me quite a lot. The design pattern is quite poor, simply because I was a junior at the time, but I still think the solutions I came about were quite ingenous honestly, specially because the API was pretty troublesome, I actually had to use two different APIs concurrently to make it work nicely and done.

## Issues

The requests are horrible! I probably could refactor it by now and made it simpler but I found the solutions I came about back then so ingenous that I chose to leave it as it is, but you actually have to make a request PER POKEMON YOU WANT TO SEE! Such a horrible API premise.
